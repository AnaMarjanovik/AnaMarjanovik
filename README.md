# 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my coding corner

I am a student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje with a strong passion for both backend and frontend development. I enjoy working with new technologies and have a growing interest in data science and bioinformatics.
I am highly motivated by problem-solving and enjoy designing and building robust systems, web applications, and services. I am driven by the challenge of turning ideas into efficient, scalable, and well-structured solutions that solve real-world problems. Beyond coding, I am a technology enthusiast at heart, always staying up to date with the latest innovations in the tech world. I enjoy learning about advancements in data-driven fields and thrive on tackling complex challenges while continuously improving my skills.
